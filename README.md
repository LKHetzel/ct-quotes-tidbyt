# Tidbyt Chrono Trigger Quote Generator

This is a Chrono Trigger quote generator for the Tidbyt, inspired by the NES Quotes generator
by [Mark McIntyre](https://github.com/tidbyt/community/tree/main/apps/nesquotes). Quotes are
stored in the versioned JSON file(s) contained in this repo and are cached for a day. Updates
are published to the existing version unless there is a schema change in the data, at which
point a new version will be published along with the corresponding code changes.

Due to the larger size of sprites in SNES titles, many were resampled to better fit the Tidbyt's
display resolution. It's not perfect, and if you're better at it than I am, please feel free
to open a pull request with improved images - they're simply base64 encoded gifs.
