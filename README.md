# Tidbyt Craig Stadler Quote Generator

This is a quote generator for the Tidbyt, inspired by the other video game quote apps.

However, instead of classics such as games for the NES or Chrono Trigger, this quote generator shows the sage advice from
Craig "The Walrus" Stadler as he appears in the 1995 game "Pebble Beach Golf Links" for the Sega Saturn.

If you're at all a fan of golf or early Sega Saturn Game memes, this is the Tidbyt app for you.

The code is forked from the Chrono Trigger quote generator by 
Jessica Chappell (https://github.com/jchappell82/ct-quotes-tidbyt)

I simply restructured the JSON file to reference a single character `thewalrus`, and added in the quotes and graphics.

The trickiest part of the display is the rendering of Craig, as the graphics were pulled from the Saturn game, they are
of higher DPI than the Tidbyt is designed for. But at a distance, he doesn't look too bad - you can make out his 'stache.

The v2 version of the quotes are not finished, due to formatting issues, but are committed to the repository for safe-keeping.
